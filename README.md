# Draw.io Shapes Collection

My attempt on creating a somewhat cohesive and close-to-reality set of Shapes for draw.io.<br>

Using 482.6pt x 44.45pt per U as default Size to 1:1 Scale a regular U in mm.<br>
Scales as needed - Sticking to 18pt for Rack Ears to keep a unified Look.<br>

Created from within draw.io instead of Shapes XML to get Shapes done in favor of speed over precision.<br>
If you'd like to contribute please include an SVG export and the original .drawio file.<br>
