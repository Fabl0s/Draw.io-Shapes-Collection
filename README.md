# Draw.io Shapes Collection

My attempt on creating a somewhat cohesive and close-to-reality set of Shapes for draw.io.

Using 482.6pt x 44.45pt per U as default Size to 1:1 Scale a regular U in mm.
Scales as needed - Sticking to 18pt for Rack Ears to keep a unified Look.

Created from within draw.io instead of Shapes XML to get Shapes done in favor of speed over precision.
If you'd like to contribute please include an SVG export and the original .drawio file.
